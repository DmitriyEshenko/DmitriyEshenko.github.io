	shaper restore all - restores shaper settings on all interfaces made by 'shaper change' command with 'temp' flag

accel-cmd
^^^^^^^^^

This application is very powerful and often used if you have `cli` connection. Be default accel-ppp listen *TCP* port *2000*  for input/output with accel-cmd. However `telnet` has same functions, but `accel-cmd` is more comfortable, allow send command without enter in to another environment. Detail about cli you may read at :ref:`cli_configuration` .Let's revise `accel-cmd` possible commands.

  * `accel-cmd show stat` - one of more important command, allow display  *accel-ppp* daemon statistics and information about connections types and something counters such as RADIUS auth, acct summary and lost queries. Detail below:

telnet
^^^^^^^^^


radius CoA
^^^^^^^^^^

Example, terminate session by username: ``echo User-Name=username | radclient -x 127.0.0.1:3799 disconnect testing123``.

snmp
^^^^
